Microsoft CTO Andreas Braun announced that GPT-4 will be released as early as next week. The new model will be multimodal and will have video capabilities. The announcement was made during the &#39;AI in Focus - Digital Kickoff&#39; hybrid event held on March 9 where Microsoft Germany employees presented LLMs like the GPT series.

Google was threatened by Facebook&#39;s rise to success in 2011\. This prompted the company to issue a decree to its employees to build social features into everything, with their bonuses tied to Google&#39;s social success. The decree resulted in ham-fisted social integrations across Google that users despised, such as YouTube comments being tied to Google+ and the real name policy. Just like with the company&#39;s social panic, its current ChatGPT panic may see employees&#39; ratings and reviews for promotions influenced by their ability to integrate artificial intelligence into their work.

Scientists from Japan have created mice with two fathers by cultivating eggs from male cells. The baby mice showed normal growth, a normal lifespan, and managed to have offspring as adults. This development may lead to treatments for infertility and could help same-sex couples have their own biological child. The researchers suggest that it could be possible to create a viable human egg from a male skin cell in less than ten years.

[**Researchers Say They&#39;ve Created Superconductors At Room Temperature (4 minute read)**](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tracking.tldrnewsletter.com&#x2F;CL0&#x2F;https:%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Fresearchers-claim-superconductors-room-temperature%3Futm%5Fsource&#x3D;tldrnewsletter&#x2F;1&#x2F;01000186cb700860-1a32c076-1a30-47ea-a607-739837c3ef6c-000000&#x2F;qWg5KCC3NaaWiYVnBnXA2oZ-biC5Kk5lhButaIukwus&#x3D;291) 

Researchers at the University of Rochester have created a superconducting material at room temperature and feasible levels of pressure. While superconductivity is already used in MRI machines, mass spectrometers, and particle accelerators, materials typically have to be kept at extremely low temperatures, making them difficult, impractical, and costly to maintain. By producing a material that exhibits superconductivity at 69 degrees Fahrenheit and ten kilobars of pressure, which is the pressure common in microchip factories, this breakthrough could lead to more cost-effective and consumer-friendly applications of superconductivity including in areas such as consumer electronics, energy transfer lines, transportation, and magnetic confinement for fusion energy.

The mirrord for Teams project required a persistent component capable of synchronizing independent uses of the service within a user&#39;s cluster. To achieve this, the team needed a Kubernetes-native and cluster-synchronized component. After researching, the team discovered the Kubernetes Operator&#x2F;Controller pattern. This article presents a step-by-step approach for newcomers interested in the operator pattern.

Silicon Valley Bank is seeking an acquisition due to a loss of roughly 60% in shares. The bank lost $1.8 billion from the sale of US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities due to rising interest rates. It announced a plan to safeguard its business by selling $1.25 billion of its common stock to investors, with the goal of raising money to stabilize itself. The response to its announcement has been overwhelmingly negative.

OpenAI&#39;s pricing for its ChatGPT model is ten times lower than its own Davinci model despite ChatGPT performing better in several areas including math, sentiment analysis, and prompt categories. The model is likely to attract customers due to its high performance and low cost, causing trouble for OpenAI&#39;s competitors, who until now had been pricing their models against the more expensive Davinci. Many Davinci users are expected to shift to ChatGPT.
